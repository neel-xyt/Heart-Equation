Heart Equation Visualization

This project visualizes a heart-shaped mathematical equation using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

Formula Used

The heart shape is generated using the following equation:

y = |x|^{\frac{2}{3}} + 0.9 \sqrt{|x| k} \sqrt{3 - x^2}

Where:

 is the horizontal coordinate.

 is an animated parameter that affects the wave pattern within the heart.

The first term  defines the basic heart curve.

The second term  adds oscillations for a dynamic effect.


Features

Animated heart shape with a dynamic k-value.

Real-time rendering using the HTML5 Canvas API.

Smooth transitions using the requestAnimationFrame loop.


Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-equation.git


2. Open index.html in a web browser.


3. Enjoy the animated heart visualization!



Future Improvements

Add interactive controls to adjust the k value manually.

Allow users to change the color and appearance dynamically.

Improve responsiveness on mobile devices.
